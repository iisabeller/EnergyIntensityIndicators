"""Overview and Assumptions: 
A. A national time series of floorspace for the commercial buildings in the US
B. Weather adjustment for the four census regions
C. Adjustment for the major reclassifications of customers by individual utilities. The reclassifications generally involve customers whose electricity purchases were classified under an industrial
rate structure being moved to commercial rate struture, and to a lesser degree, customers moving from a commercial rate to an industrial rate classification. These reclassfications can distort the 
short term aggregate changes in commercial and industrial electricity consumption, as reported by EIA's Estimation of National Commercial Floorspace

Data Sources: New construction is based on data from Dodge Data and Analytics, available from the published versions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States (SAUS)

Methodology: Perpetual inventory model, where estimates of new additions and removals are added to the previous year's estimate of stock to update the current year"""
